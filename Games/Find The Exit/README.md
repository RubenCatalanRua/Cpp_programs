This game is playable on Linux machines and Linux subsystems.

To play, first you must compile the file in the directory where it's located. You must install g++ on your machine, you can do so 
with the command: 'sudo apt install g++' (if you're using a Debian-based linux distribution).

Afterwards, simply type 'g++ FindTheExit.cc -o program.exe' to compile and create an executable of the program. You can then launch it
with: './program.exe'.

Have fun!
